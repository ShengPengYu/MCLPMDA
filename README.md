A novel method for miRNA-disease association prediction based on matrix completion and label propagation

**1.Method Description:**<br> 
We propose a novel method for miRNA-disease association prediction based on matrix completion and label propagation. Specifically, our<br>  method first reconstructs a new miRNA/disease similarity matrix by matrix completion algorithm based on known experimentally<br>  verified miRNA-disease associations and then utilizes the label propagation algorithm to reliably predict disease-related miRNAs. <br> 
<br> 
**2.Method Requirements:**<br> 
(1). The project was developed based on a matrix library named ND4j(https://nd4j.org/). <br> 
(2). In order to introduce the project documents more clearly, I put all the source code on the front page.<br> 
(3). As GitHub has upload capacity limit, I did not upload the third party jar package, only uploaded the core code of the project. It <br>        can be downloaded directly  from the official web(https://nd4j.org/)<br> 

**3. Usage:**<br>
To run our method, simply open the "job.java" script in java programming environment or other java IDE tools (e.g. Eclipse) and press<br> 
"Run" button. Another option is to run our script using the command line format by two steps: (1)javac Job.java (2) java Job <br>
